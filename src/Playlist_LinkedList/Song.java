    // The albums will be stored in an ArrayList
    // Songs from different albums can be added to the playlist and will appear in the list in the order
    // they are added.
    // Once the songs have been added to the playlist, create a menu of options to:-
    // Quit,Skip forward to the next song, skip backwards to a previous song.  Replay the current song.

    // A song must exist in an album before it can be added to the playlist (so you can only play songs that
    // you own).

    // started tracking the direction we were going.
    // As an optional extra, provide an option to remove the current song from the playlist
